The spaceship is controlled by tilting it left(LEFT ARROW) or right(RIGHT ARROW) and by creating an upthrust 
from the engine using SPACE_KEY(this decreases fuel).

The ship has one mission: to land on one of the landing pads.
Landing conditions:
  1.The ship must not be tilted to any side more than 5 degrees
  2.The velocity of the ship must not be too large
  3.The craft must have enough fuel and health(Damage must be less than 100)
 
 There are meteors spawning at random times with random sizes and speeds. Each meteor accounts for 10 damage.
 There are obstacles in the flying space which also deal certain damage.
 There is a status bar at the top left corner that displays real-time statistics.
